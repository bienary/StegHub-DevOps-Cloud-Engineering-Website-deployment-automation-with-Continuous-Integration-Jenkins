# 🌐 Automation of Website Deployment with Continuous Integration Using Jenkins

This project builds upon previous work introducing horizontal scalability for the Tooling Website by enabling the deployment of multiple web servers. While manually configuring a small number of servers is feasible, scaling to dozens or hundreds requires automation to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability.

Jenkins is widely used to implement Continuous Integration (CI), a practice where developers frequently commit small, incremental changes that are automatically built and tested to improve development speed and quality.

In this project, Jenkins is configured to continuously integrate and deploy updates to the NFS Server. Any change pushed to the GitHub repository triggers an automated pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the updated application. This automation ensures a fast, consistent, and reliable deployment workflow—supporting scalable infrastructure and modern DevOps best practices.
